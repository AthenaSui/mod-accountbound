# Account Bound
This module aims to make mounts shared across every character on an account.

I am unsure about how the check for required level and required skill will handle a larger amount of players using the feature. This is mostly a proof of concept for me. The spell itself doesn't have the values needed to handle that, but I will update this module if I manage to find a better way.
