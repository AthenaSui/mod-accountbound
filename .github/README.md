# Features
This module aims to make mounts, companions and heirlooms shared across all characters of an account.

Companions and mounts that are specific to Alliance or Horde will be converted to the correct version of the companion or mount whenever a character receives them.

There is no way to see all mounts that the account has unless the character has the required skill, unfortunately there is no way to handle this yet. The character will automatically receive the mounts linked to their account whenever they learn the riding skills.

An addon that helps the user see all their mounts may be developed in the future.
